# Student Predictions, Student Protections

## Original Session Description

Data science, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence have become critical business tools. By learning from
past business failures, educators can avoid dangerous pitfalls that might harm students. We will learn how algorithmic
biases can perpetuate racism and inequality. We will also learn how systems can bend statistics to hide poor predictive
performance. Finally, we will learn key questions you can ask as buyers and consumers to expose these problems and
protect your students.
